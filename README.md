# Risk-Management-Policy-For-ABC-Bank

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project is on reviewing and updating ABC Bank (a fictional bank) Risk Management Policy. I reviewed and updated the organization's risk policy for compliance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's risk management framework NIST SP 800-53.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
ABC Bank (a fictional bank) is updating its risk management policy. The organization is currently moving its IT
infrastructure to a hybrid cloud model. Therefore, it’s important for the organization’s risk management policy to align with external regulations to avoid the negative impacts of non-compliance.

The purpose of this project is: <strong>(1)</strong> To access ABC Bank (a fictional bank) risk management policy. <strong>(2)</strong> Identify areas for improvement and <strong>(3)</strong> Provide reasoning for the changes.
<h2>ABC Bank: Risk Management Policy</h2>
<strong>Purpose:</strong> This policy has been created to identify, assess, and manage risks associated with ABC Bank’s use of hybrid cloud solutions. This policy includes guidelines to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ABC Bank’s cloud resources.
<h3>1. Access Control</h3>
○ If an employee expects to leave their workstation unattended, they must lock
their workstation. Employee workstations may not be configured to automatically lock.
○ Privileged functions include access to sensitive data and the ability to modify system configurations, such as security settings. Privileged functions can be carried out by non-privileged accounts, if necessary.
<h3>2. Awareness and Training</h3>
○ New employees will be trained on current cyber threats.
○ All new employees must receive identical cyber threat training, regardless of their role.
<h3>3. Configuration Management</h3>
○ All users can install software on their work devices, as necessary.
○ Before system changes are implemented, they should be analyzed for their potential security impacts.
<h3>4. Identification and Authentication</h3>
○ User passwords are required to be complex and must be changed regularly. User passwords may not contain spaces or punctuation.
○ Maintain a list of commonly used, expected, or compromised passwords and update the list once per month. When a user attempts to change their password, verify that the new password is not on the list.
<h3>5. Incident Response</h3>
○ Employees whose responsibilities are part of incident response should receive incident response training within one week of assuming those responsibilities. More training should be conducted every three months or as required by system changes, and the training content should be updated each year.
○ Incident response training should include simulated incidents to facilitate employees practicing their responsibilities.
<h3>6. Physical and Environmental Protection</h3>
○ The security team must develop and maintain a list of individuals who are authorized to access Cymbal Bank’s server room. These individuals must be granted authorization credentials and cannot be removed from the list once added.
○ In order to access the server room, visitors must provide two forms of identification from the approved list.
<h3>7. Risk Assessment</h3>
○ The security team must determine the current cyber threat environment on an ongoing basis using security newsletters and cyber threat databases.
○ The security team monitors and scans for vulnerabilities in the cloud environment.
<h3>8. System and Information Integrity</h3>
○ Cymbal Bank uses centrally managed identity verification tools to verify employee and user identity.
○ Security alert and advisory information should be shared throughout the security team on a regular basis.

<tr>
<td><strong>Access Control</strong></td>
<td>In addition to requiring employees to lock their devices, devices should be configured to automatically lock after two minutes of inactivity and require the user to reenter their credentials when they return.</td>
<td>If an employee leaves a device unlocked while stepping away from their workstation, the information on the device may be vulnerable to unauthorized people. This could result in a data breach, which poses reputational and legal risks to the company. Configuring devices to automatically lock after two minutes decreases these risks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Awareness and Training</strong></td>
<td>New employees should still be trained on cyber threats. Training should be added for current employees on a regular basis and when system changes make training necessary. Training should be specific to each employee's role.</td>
<td>The cyber threat landscape is constantly changing, so it’s important that employees be trained regularly on cybersecurity best practices to prevent a data breach or other incident. Employees in different roles and departments have access to specific information that could result in different kinds of risk—such as business slowdowns if needed systems stop working—or legal risk if sensitive data is leaked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Configuration Management</strong></td>
<td>Users can install approved, vetted software on their workstations as necessary. Unvetted and/or unapproved software may not be downloaded on devices.</td>
<td>Allowing users to download unvetted software may lead users to download applications that could introduce malware into the environment. Therefore, it is important for Cymbal Bank to know and control the software installed onto its systems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Identification and Authentication</strong></td>
<td>Employee passwords should be allowed to contain spaces and special characters.</td>
<td>Including special characters allows employees to create stronger, more complex passwords. This makes it more difficult for bad actors to gain unauthorized access, which could lead to data loss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Physical and Environmental Protection</strong></td>
<td>Individuals must be removed from the server room authorization list if they no longer have a business need to access it.</td>
<td>If an employee switches roles or leaves the company, the individual no longer has a business need to access Cymbal Bank’s server room. Access needs to be tightly controlled to ensure the servers and the data they’re processing aren't vulnerable to unauthorized people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>System and Information Integrity</strong></td>
<td>Security alert and advisory information should be shared throughout the entire organization, not just with the security team.</td>
<td>It’s important for all employees to receive security alerts and advisory information because all employees need to contribute to keep the organization’s infrastructure secure.</td>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
With this project, I was able to identify areas where organizations can safeguards its assets, improve its security posture by ensuring regulatory compliance with NIST SP 800-53. It also enhances my critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills while giving practical experience in implementing security measures that protect an organization's operations.
